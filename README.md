## Indigo

Indigo is a light-weight, open -sourced, easy to use UI Library for ROBLOX. Indigo is based on ROBLOX React, another popular Library. 

## Why Indigo?

Whilst Roact offers more features, this serves as an alternative that is easier and simpler to use. It retains functions from Roact such as:
  * Creating Elements (Properties, children, and events)
  * Mounting Elements
  * Unmounting Elements
  * Updating Elements
  * Creating and Running Components
  * Hydrating

    ## How do I use Indigo?

Indigo is meant to be easy to setup and use. You can find the Open - Source documentation within this github. Indigo bundles with only a few (but powerfull) functions,
that can be used to create anything you want.
