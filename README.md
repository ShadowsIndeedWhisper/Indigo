# Home

Indigo is a _simple GUI Library_ made for _ROBLOX_, inspired by [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/). The documentation here is centred around **Indigo**, and not Roact. Although small, Indigo is capable of many things.





{% hint style="info" %}
The documentation for Indigo requires you to have some knowledge with lua. I reccomend you learn the basics of lua first before using Indigo.
